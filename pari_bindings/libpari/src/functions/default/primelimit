Doc: \kbd{gp} precomputes a list of
 all primes less than \kbd{primelimit} at initialization time, and can build
 fast sieves on demand to quickly iterate over primes up to the \emph{square}
 of \kbd{primelimit}. These are used by many arithmetic functions, usually for
 trial division purposes.

 Since almost all arithmetic functions eventually require some table of prime
 numbers, PARI guarantees that the first 6547 primes, up to and
 including 65557, are precomputed, even if \kbd{primelimit} is $1$.

 The maximal value for practical purposes is $436273289$ (the largest prime
 such that all prime gaps below the threshold are < 255), but values beyond
 $10^8$, allowing to iterate over primes up to $10^{16}$, do not seem useful.

 The default can be set to a higher value, up to $2^{64}-2049$ on
 a 64-bit machine ! But the precomputed prime table will be truncated at the
 maximal value given above. This allows to use \kbd{primelimit} as an
 indication of how far one might want to trial divide by default, even if the
 missing primes must be computed on the spot. Note this is of dubious value
 since the function will soon get \emph{very} slow without precomputations
 and better factoring algorithms are used internally. (See also the
 Deprecated feature below.)

 This default is only used on startup: changing it will not recompute a new
 table. On startup, a product tree of all primes in the table is also
 computed to speed up trial division of large integers up to
 \kbd{primelimit}. This takes some time, so \kbd{primelimit} should not
 been taken too large; here are sample timings for startup using increasing
 values:
 \bprog
 2^20:      40 ms
 2^23:     190 ms
 2^26:   1,980 ms
 max:   18,071 ms
 @eprog\noindent (The maximal value 436273289 is about $2^{28.7}$.)

 \misctitle{Deprecated feature} \kbd{primelimit} was used in some
 situations by algebraic number theory functions using the
 \tet{nf_PARTIALFACT} flag (\tet{nfbasis}, \tet{nfdisc}, \tet{nfinit}, \dots):
 this assumes that all primes $p > \kbd{primelimit}$ have a certain
 property (the equation order is $p$-maximal). This is never done by default,
 and must be explicitly set by the user of such functions. Nevertheless,
 these functions now provide a more flexible interface, and their use
 of the global default \kbd{primelimit} is deprecated.

 \misctitle{Deprecated feature} \kbd{factor(N, 0)} was used to partially
 factor integers by removing all prime factors $\leq$ \kbd{primelimit}.
 Don't use this, supply an explicit bound: \kbd{factor(N, bound)},
 which avoids relying on an unpredictable global variable.

 The default value is $2^{20} = 1048576$.
